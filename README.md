# Settings Manager

This is a basic settings manager I made using Json to keep track of a few user settings.

There's not much to it, just be sure to change "YourProjectName" in `AppFolderPath = $"{appData}/YourProjectName";` then add your settings to the `SettingsModel` and let Newtonsoft.Json handle the rest.
